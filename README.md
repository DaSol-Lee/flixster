### Notes

Errors I faced: 
  - SIGABRT Error 
  - Black screen after launching
  - Error that my "TableViewController" and "NavigationController is unreachable because it has no entry points and no runtime access. 
  - Could not print to console view
  
How I fixed these errors:
  - Realized I had to make a screen "is Initial View Controller"
  - Fixed Outlets because one label was used as the same outlet twice
  - Forgot to remove a line of code that was changed in the video walkthrough so there were two contradictory lines
  - Used Shift + Command + C to enable console view, because it was disabled on my mac

My notes:
- Learning Goal for Flix part 1 -> Implement Scrolling
- AppDelegate.swift : runs first time when app launches
- ViewController : screen, both collection of views and logic
- main.storyboard : where views are designed; arrow indicates first screen
- alpha : transparency
- Asset folder : add images
- Use Media Library to add images to screen (click Object Library and it is the next tab)
    - a Media Library image and an image view is the same, except the media library image auto-resizes
- Shift + Command + C shows console view
- var Movies [[String:Any]]() // Creation of an array of dictionaries; " () " indicates creation
- download array of movies and variable
- Casting as! String tells you type 

Table View Recipe:
1. Add parameters : UITableViewDataSource and UITableViewDelegate
2. Add outlets
3. Change the 2 lines to self
4. Add those 2 functions on the bottom
5. Implement count, cell creation, and reload data
